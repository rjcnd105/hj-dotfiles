"""
mask-secrets.py — credential masking for text the scripts copy out of transcripts.

Not a command. detect-mechanical.py, scan-cross-session.py and
derive-session-scope.py load it by path (the file name is hyphenated like its
siblings) and pass every piece of transcript text they emit through
`squeeze()` or `mask()`. A transcript holds whatever went through the session —
`GH_TOKEN=… gh pr create`, a failed push echoing a tokenised remote URL, a key
pasted into a prompt — and the findings are what a retro quotes into memory
files, issues and pull requests.

`squeeze()` collapses whitespace, masks, and only then truncates. Truncating
first can cut a token below the pattern's minimum length, and its head then
ships in clear.
