collect-review-findings.py — what reviewers, maintainers and tickets said about
a session's PRs, MRs and issues.

A review finding is a defect that passed every check the agent ran. That makes
it the most precise input a retro gets — and until now the retro saw one only
when the agent happened to read it inside the session. Findings that arrived
later, bot reviews nobody opened, and the feedback a team writes into the
ticket instead of the PR never reached it.

This script reads them from the forge and the tracker:

- per PR (GitHub): review threads, review bodies, PR comments, commits
- per MR (GitLab): discussions (threads and plain notes), commits
- linked issues: GitHub `closingIssuesReferences`, GitLab `closes_issues`, and
  issue URLs in the PR/MR description — their comments
- additional trackers: normalized evidence explicitly supplied with --feedback-file
- short references in titles, branches and tool exchanges: unresolved hints,
  never an instruction to discover a tracker or try its default account

Every answer by somebody else inside a thread is its own `review-reply`
finding: a human's "please do fix it" under a bot finding the agent rejected is
the feedback that overturns the rejection. A GitLab host is contacted only when
named with `--gitlab-host` (default `$GITLAB_HOST`), because `glab` sends its
token to whatever host it is given.

Every finding carries `source`, `author_class` (`self` · `bot` · `human`),
`resolved` where the forge says so, and `commit_after`: the first commit on
the PR/MR dated after the finding. That is a necessary sign that the finding
changed the code, not proof — any later commit qualifies. A rebase re-dates
every commit it replays, so a commit whose author date is also after the
finding is preferred. Read it together with `resolved` and `last_self_reply`.

`self` is the account running the native readers (GitHub `viewer`, GitLab
`user`) plus every `--self-login`. External integrations classify their own
accounts before supplying feedback; login names do not identify people across
systems.

Usage:
    collect-review-findings.py --transcript-file <session.jsonl> [--since ISO]
        [--include-mentioned] [--output-format text|json]
    collect-review-findings.py --ref <artifact URL or unresolved short reference> [--ref …]
    collect-review-findings.py --transcript-file <session.jsonl> --pr-list <opened.jsonl>

A PR/MR a script opened inside one call never shows in the transcript. Its
list — one URL, or one JSON object with `url`, per line — goes in with
`--pr-list`; those PRs are read like the session's own, with origin `listed`.

Failure stays distinguishable from silence: an artefact that could not be read
is listed with `fetched: false` and the error, never as an artefact with no
findings. Comments from before `--since` (default: the transcript's first
timestamp) are counted, not listed — on a linked issue they are the request,
not feedback on the work.
