"""Render an opencode session as the JSONL shape `detect-mechanical.py` reads.

    python3 opencode-transcript.py --match "<a token from the session>" \\
        [--db ~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db] [--session <id>] > session.jsonl

WHY THIS EXISTS. `detect-mechanical.py` parses a Claude Code transcript, and an
agent running under opencode keeps its session somewhere else entirely: a SQLite
database, `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`, as JSON in one of two schemas.
Without this, layer A simply cannot run on those sessions — the operator is left
doing the LLM pass by hand, which is the cost this project exists to remove.

TWO SCHEMAS, chosen per session by which table holds its rows:

  · V2 (opencode 2.x): `session_v2` + `session_message`, one row per message,
    ordered by `seq`. The role is the `type` COLUMN — `data` carries no `role` —
    and an assistant's blocks sit in `data.content[]`;
  · legacy (opencode 1.x): `message` + `part`, the role in `message.data` and the
    blocks in `part.data`, one row each.

A session found in both is rendered from V2. opencode 2.x copies every 1.x
session into the V2 tables under the same id and never deletes the legacy rows,
but writes new messages only to V2 — a fresh 2.x database has no `message` or
`part` table at all — so the legacy copy of such a session stops at the upgrade.
A database that has neither table set is refused.

THE SESSION IS FOUND BY CONTENT. `--match` takes any token from the session under
review and greps the stored JSON for it, exactly as `references/workflow.md`
requires of the Claude path: several sessions share one project, so the newest row
is regularly somebody else's. `--session` skips the search when the id is known.

THE LEGACY MAPPING, and the two places it had to be discovered by measuring:

  · a `text` part becomes a `text` block; a `synthetic` one, which opencode
    injected rather than the user typed, is dropped;
  · a `tool` part holds BOTH the call and its result, so it becomes a `tool_use`
    block on the assistant turn AND a `tool_result` block on a user turn
    immediately after — which is where Claude puts it;
  · every `tool_use` NEEDS an `id` and every `tool_result` a matching `tool_use_id`.
    Without them `detect-mechanical.py` raises `KeyError: 'id'` on its first tool
    block, so the id falls back through `callID` to the part's own row id.

THE V2 MAPPING, read from opencode's `packages/schema/src/session-message.ts` at
v2.0.15: a `user` row's `data.text` becomes a `text` block; an `assistant` row's
`text` blocks stay, `reasoning` blocks are dropped as in the legacy path, and a
`tool` block (`id`, `name`, `state.input`) becomes the same `tool_use` +
`tool_result` pair. Its output is `state.content[]` and its error
`state.error.message`; there is no `state.output`. A `streaming` call carries
its input as a partial JSON STRING, which the detector would call `.get` on.
A `running` or `streaming` call gets no result, and neither does a
`tool.interrupted` error, which is how 2.x copies a 1.x call that was still
running at the upgrade. The other row types (`synthetic`, `shell`,
`compaction`, `system`, …) are not rendered.

TOOL NAMES. opencode names its tools `bash` (1.x) or `shell` (2.x), `read`,
`edit`, … and its file tools take `filePath` (1.x) or `path` (2.x); the
detector's signals match Claude's `Bash`, `Read`, `Edit` and `file_path`. Both
are renamed, or every shell and file signal passes over an opencode session
without firing. A migrated session keeps the 1.x names. `patch` (2.x) and
`apply_patch` (1.x) become `Patch`, with the files the patch headers name in
`file_paths`; the detector's A12 counts it as an edit of each. Relative file
paths are resolved against the session's directory, so a patch that names
`src/app.py` and a read of `/repo/src/app.py` count as the same file; 2.x
expands `~` and `~/…` to a home directory the database does not record, so
those stay as they are — except in a call 2.x copied from a 1.x session
(`filePath`, `apply_patch`), which keeps 1.x's rule and is joined like any
other relative path. A 2.x session can be moved or forked; each row is
resolved against the directory it ran in, taken from the `location-switched`
rows and, for a fork's copied rows, the parent's.

READ-ONLY. The database is opened with `mode=ro`, so pointing this at a live
database cannot corrupt a session that is still being written.
