derive-session-scope.py — the repositories, days and artefacts a session touched.

Front-end for gate 4 of `/retro done`. That gate is only as wide as the set it
sweeps: `git worktree list` in the wrong repository returns clean, and a ✅ that
measured nothing is worse than a ❌. Until now `references/done-mode.md` said
the repository list was "an input, not an output" because no command produced
it, so it came from what the agent remembered doing.

That is exactly where it fails. In the session that prompted this script the
agent named three repositories and reported the sweep clean; asked again it
found eight, two of them holding leftovers. This script, on the same
transcript, returned fifteen — and two of the seven nobody had looked at held
an orphaned branch and a dirty working tree. Every round was an honest
recollection and every round was short, because remembering is the wrong
instrument for a list that is written down, verbatim, in the transcript.

So this reads the transcript and emits the scope line. Every path a `git -C`,
a `cd`, a file write or a `--repo`/`-R` argument named, resolved to its
repository root, plus the days the session spans and the artefacts it created.

Usage:
    derive-session-scope.py --transcript-file <session.jsonl> [--output-format text|json]
        [--gitlab-host <host>]

The output is a starting point that is complete where the transcript is: a
repository the session only ever reached through a tool with no path in its
input cannot appear here. Read the list, add what you know is missing, and
sweep that — the point is that nothing the transcript recorded is silently
dropped.
