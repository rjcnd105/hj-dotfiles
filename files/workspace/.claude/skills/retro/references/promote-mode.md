# Promote Mode — `/retro promote`

Every other retro mode reads the session **flow** (a transcript) and detects
friction as it happens. Promote reads the accumulated **stock**: the
cwd-scoped memory files Claude Code's default memory behaviour writes to
`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/`. It re-homes each note upward to its correct
destination and drains the source — turning the "never project-local memory"
rule from a *going-forward* policy into an action you can run on the backlog.

It is a new **front-end** for the existing pipeline, not a new pipeline: it
replaces Phases 1–3 (transcript detection) with a filesystem inventory and
reuses Phases 4–10 (classify → approve → materialize → report) unchanged.

## Why this mode exists

Project-local memory (`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/`, a project
`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/feedback/`) is a **knowledge silo**: cwd-scoped, shared with
no one, and invisible from any other slug. A note written while `cwd` resolved
to `-home-sme` is never recalled while working in `-home-sme-p-retro-skill`.
Promote drains that silo into the shareable destinations the taxonomy already
defines, in priority order: **canonical-source › skill-update › project-rule
(`AGENTS.md`) › personal-rule (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)** — see the authority axis
and the scope-escalation rule in `classification-heuristic.md`. A note whose
substance is a fact owned outside the agent system (upstream docs, code, a
schema) promotes to that owner; the skill keeps at most a reference plus the
agent-specific delta.

## What the scanner reads (and excludes)

`scripts/scan-memory-inventory.py` is read-only by construction. It emits the
same envelope shape as `detect-mechanical.py`, so Phases 4–10 consume it as-is.

| Scanned | Signal | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `<slug>/memory/*.md` (feedback notes) | `C3` memory_drift | The canonical promotable stock |
| `<slug>/memory/MEMORY.md` | — | Read as the index; pruned on drain, never itself a finding |
| `<slug>/memory/.promoted/*.md` | — | Tombstones (already drained) — skipped, never re-emitted |
| `<project>/CLAUDE.md`, `docs/feedback/*.md` | `B8` wrong_destination | **Opt-in** via `--include-flagged-locations` |
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, one finding per `##` section | `C2` cross_project_pattern | **Opt-in** via `--include-global-rules` — see "Draining the global rules file" |

**Excluded by construction** (never part of the scan surface — the scanner only
globs `<slug>/memory/*.md`, so these are never enumerated in the first place):
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` unless `--include-global-rules` is passed and
`<project>/AGENTS.md` always (they are correct *destinations* — re-promoting
them by default loops), and `.serena/memories/*.md` (project-overview
context, not behaviour rules — would pollute global memory).

### Draining the global rules file (`--include-global-rules`)

The global rules file is where personal preferences *land*, so it is not a
default source. It still accumulates a second kind of content: learned rules
whose substance is team-usable procedure or domain fact (a CLI gotcha, a
release recipe, an API trap). Those reach more people as a `skill-update` than
as private prose, and this opt-in surfaces each `##` section so the classifier
can judge it. Three binding rules:

1. **Always-on behavior never leaves the file.** A skill loads only when
   triggered. Rules that must hold in every turn — bans, tone rules,
   assumption-marking, verification discipline — are not promotable to a
   skill; at most they *pair* with an enforcement gate (hook/checkpoint) while
   the prose stays. When in doubt, the section stays.
2. **Two-direction test.** Promote a section only when BOTH hold: the content
   generalizes beyond this user, AND losing it from always-loaded context is
   safe because the owning skill reliably triggers when the content matters.
3. **Drain is an agent edit, not the `drain` subcommand.** The subcommand
   refuses paths outside `<slug>/memory/` by design. After the skill PR is
   verified to exist, remove the section from the rules file with an ordinary
   approval-gated edit, re-checking the scan's `content_sha256` against the
   section text first (same race-check semantics). One section per edit.
   Section-removal is markdown surgery and boundary regexes are FENCE-BLIND: a
   `#`-anchored section-heading boundary also matches `#` comment lines inside code
   fences, leaving orphaned section tails (observed live). Remove sections
   fence-aware (track ``` state, or operate on a parsed structure), and verify
   afterwards that fences are balanced and the section count dropped by exactly
   the number removed.

Each finding carries the source note's verbatim `**Why:**` / `**How to apply:**`
prose, its `origin_session_id`, a `current_location` tag (the load-bearing
evidence the LLM reads at Phase 4), and a `content_sha256` used as both an
idempotency key and a drain race-check.

### Scope

`--project` with a leading-dash slug needs the equals form (`--project=-home-user-projects`) — argparse consumes the bare form as an option and errors "expected one argument".

`--scope cwd` (default) scans only the slug derived from the cwd; `--scope all`
enumerates every slug that has a `memory/` dir. The scanner **always** reports
`slugs_scanned` so an empty result reads as "scanned X, found nothing" rather
than a silent skip — this guards the worktree-vs-parent slug split (the real
stock often lives under a sibling slug). If `cwd` finds nothing, re-run with
`--scope all`.

## Batch semantics — a proposal absorbs notes, the cap counts proposals

A backlog drain meets hundreds of notes; per-note proposals under the ≤10 cap
would spread one drain across dozens of sessions. In promote mode a **proposal
is destination-shaped, not note-shaped**: one proposal = one materialization
target (one skill PR, one AGENTS.md append), absorbing every scanned note that
classifies to it. Rules:

- The proposal lists every absorbed note by path, with its `content_sha256`.
  Approval of the proposal approves the set; the user can strike individual
  notes from the list.
- One proposal counts once against the ≤10 cap regardless of how many notes it
  absorbs.
- The mechanical halves of a materialization repeat identically per proposal —
  use `scripts/materialize-pr.sh` (`start` = fetch + fresh worktree off the
  default branch; `finish` = stage ONLY named files, signed commit, push, PR
  via `--body-file`) instead of hand-typing the sequence dozens of times.
- Drain stays per-note: each absorbed note is drained individually (verified
  materialization first), so a partially-landed proposal leaves the
  unmaterialized notes in place.

## Verify before promoting — stale facts and paraphrase duplicates

Two checks run at Phase 7, before a note enters a proposal:

- **Stale-check.** A `reference`-type note records what was true when written.
  Before promoting one, verify its load-bearing claim against reality (does
  the path/flag/endpoint/version still exist?). A stale note is proposed for
  **tombstone-only drain** (no upward write), clearly labeled.
- **Paraphrase dedup.** `content_sha256` catches identical text, not the same
  rule reworded — and stock notes are often already duplicated into
  `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or the target skill. Read the *target* location and
  compare mechanisms (not titles): if the target already covers the same
  mechanism, the note is proposed for tombstone-only drain with the covering
  location cited; if the target covers an adjacent mechanism only, promote and
  say what is genuinely new. This is the same read-the-target rule as
  "Instruction pruning" in `classification-heuristic.md`.

## Materialize-then-drain (Phase 9)

Source deletion is **last** and **gated on confirmed materialization**, per item:

1. **Write/PR first** — append the titled rule to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or
   `<project>/AGENTS.md`, or open the `feat/retro-<slug>` PR with a signed
   (`git commit -s`) commit.
2. **Verify** — for file appends, re-read the target and confirm the rule text
   is present; for PRs, confirm `gh`/`glab` returned a URL (PR *exists* =
   materialized; merge is not required).
3. **Drain only now** — `scan-memory-inventory.py drain <path> --expect-sha256 <sha>`
   tombstone-**moves** the source into `<slug>/memory/.promoted/` (never `rm`)
   and prunes its `MEMORY.md` bullet. The `--expect-sha256` race-check aborts
   the drain if the file changed since the scan.

On any verification failure, **keep the source** and report it. Rejected
proposals are never drained.

## Risk controls

1. **Naming.** `promote` names exactly what Phases 7–9 do (re-home upward by
   reach) and fits the `/retro <verb>` convention. (`dream` / `upsert` rejected.)
2. **Team-visibility of personal notes.** Two layers: (a) at Phase 4, personal
   content (a `$HOME` path, an "I prefer…" style note) is **not** auto-escalated
   past personal-rule; (b) at Phase 8, every `project-rule` / `skill-update`
   proposal triggers a mandatory, default-**N** warning stating exactly where it
   becomes team-visible and that the source is currently private. The promotion
   and its paired drain are one approval unit.
3. **Deletion timing / data loss.** Strict write → verify → drain ordering;
   drain is a reversible tombstone move, never `rm`; no verified success → no
   drain, ever; sha256 race-check guards concurrent edits.
4. **Not everything should escalate.** Store-class discrimination keeps the
   scanner to genuine silos; correct destinations and Serena context are never
   emitted; the `drain` subcommand refuses any path not under a `<slug>/memory/`
   store, so a drained note can't be re-filed downward.
5. **Separation from `audit`.** Clean seam by input and output: `audit` reads
   cross-session transcripts/git history over weeks and skews to ADR/harness
   destinations; `promote` reads the filesystem stock of memory files (no
   transcript, no time window) and skews to user/project/skill destinations.
