# Done Mode — `/retro done`

Every other retro mode asks *what did we learn*. Done mode asks *are we actually
finished* — and refuses to say so until seven gates hold with evidence. It
exists because "done" was being declared with the retro not run and the time
not booked: the original task was complete, the session was not.

It is a **gate**, not a detector: it reuses the pipeline's approval and
materialization phases (8–10) for the writes it triggers (bookings, ticket
comments) and chains the Sweep for gate 3 when no retro has run yet.

## The seven gates

A gate is ✅ only with evidence from the system that owns the truth — a status
read back, a URL, a command's output — never from what the agent remembers
doing.

| Mark | Meaning | Closes by |
|------|---------|-----------|
| ✅ | holds, with evidence | — |
| ❌ | work remains | doing it |
| ⏸ | **waiting on the user**, and the user can close it | one named answer or action |
| N/A | does not apply here, with the reason | nothing — it is already settled |

**⏸ and N/A are not interchangeable.** Determine applicability from the
project/organization policy, not from the repository type or the presence of a
ticket. Work without a ticket may still require time recording. A missing
integration or unknown required booking target is not N/A: name the person and
action that can unblock it. Use N/A only with evidence that the requirement does
not apply; do not invent a ticket or a time-accounting obligation.

So: **⏸ only when a named person can close it with a named action.** Everything
structurally absent is N/A with its reason. `done` may be said when every row is
✅ or N/A.

| # | Gate | Evidence that closes it |
|---|------|-------------------------|
| 1 | **Task** — the original request, as the user phrased it, is delivered | Every artefact named with its live state: PR/MR (state, checks, threads, `mergeStateStatus` / `detailed_merge_status`), issue, tag, deploy. "I pushed" is not a state. |
| 2 | **Findings** — every interim finding is *fixed*, *filed* or *rejected* | One row per finding: fixed (commit SHA) · filed (issue/ticket URL in the row — "filed" without a URL is not filed) · rejected (one-line reason the user has seen). The native and explicitly supplied tracker findings are listed by `collect-review-findings.py --transcript-file <session.jsonl>` — every open thread and every human comment there is a row. Resolve relevant coverage gaps from `complete: false` before passing this gate; see `feedback-contract.md`. |
| 3 | **Retro** — the Sweep ran for this session | A materialized artefact from it: a memory file written, a skill PR opened, a rule edited — each named with its path or URL. "I ran it" is the same self-report the other gates refuse. No such artefact and no explicit *all rejected* record → Done mode runs the Sweep now (Phases 1–10) before continuing. |
| 4 | **Cleanup** — nothing of the session's own making is left running or lying around | The sweep list below, each line with its command output. |
| 5 | **Questions** — nothing is pending on the user that the task still needs | Either no open question, or exactly one human-gated decision stated once with the exact command, and the loop stopped there. Re-listing a parked decision is a ❌. |
| 6 | **Tickets** — required outcomes are recorded on the confirmed work items | Print each canonical URL, native state and responsible party where applicable, read back after approved writes. Apply the owning project's QA, hand-back and assignment rules; do not invent status names or transitions. N/A only when no ticket obligation applies. Unresolved relevant references or unavailable required integrations are not a pass. |
| 7 | **Time** — applicable time-accounting obligations are met | List the required per-day entries and read-back evidence from the configured service. Apply the project/organization policy, not a default provider. N/A requires an explicit applicability reason; missing tickets alone are not enough. See *Booking* below. |

## Cleanup sweep (gate 4)

**Name the scope before running anything, and derive it — do not recall it.**
The sweep is only as wide as the set it runs over, and `git worktree list` in
the wrong repository returns clean: a ✅ that measured nothing. The list comes
from the transcript, which recorded every path verbatim:

```bash
uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/derive-session-scope.py" \
  --transcript-file "$TF"        # $TF located as in workflow.md § Shared pipeline
```

`uv run` installs the shell parser the script declares in its header
(tree-sitter-bash); plain `python3` stops with a message saying so.

It prints the repositories, the days, the tags, the forge slugs addressed by
`-R`, and the paths it could not resolve — read that last group, because a path
built from a shell variable is where a missing entry hides. Add anything you
know it cannot see (a repository reached only through a tool that took no
path), then sweep that.

**Recalling the list does not work, and the failure is silent.** In the session
that prompted the script the agent named three repositories, swept them, and
reported cleanup ✅. Asked again it found eight and two held leftovers. The
script, run on the same transcript, returned **fifteen** — and two of the seven
nobody had looked at held an orphaned branch and a dirty worktree. Each round
was honest and each was short, because the instrument was memory.

**Touched is not the same as made.** The script lists every repository the
session entered, including ones it only read. The sweep *inspects* all of them
and *removes* only what this session created: a worktree it added, a branch it
pushed, a process it started. A stale branch from July in a repository you only
grepped belongs to whoever left it — report it in the table and leave it, as
the Boundaries section requires.

```bash
# $SCRATCH is the scratchpad path from the system prompt — it is NOT in the
# environment, and unset it would expand to `du -sh /*`, walking the root
# filesystem. Set it explicitly and let the sweep fail loudly if it is missing.
SCRATCH="${SCRATCH:?paste the scratchpad path from the system prompt}"

pgrep -af 'php -S|node|python -m http'          # dev servers a subagent started
pgrep -af "$SCRATCH|make gate|runTests|--watch|until gh"   # this session's own
docker ps -a                                    # see the ownership note below
du -sh "$SCRATCH"/*                             # scratch disk

for r in <the repositories named above>; do     # per repo, never just the cwd
  git -C "$r" worktree list
  git -C "$r" branch -vv | grep ': gone]'       # remote deleted
done

# Stash and status need a WORKING TREE. In the bare-repo layout the path above
# is `<project>/.bare`, where both abort with "fatal: this operation must be run
# in a work tree" — and `| wc -l` turns that abort into a reassuring 0. Read the
# checkouts out of the repository and ask them instead:
for r in <the repositories named above>; do
  # `sed`, not `awk '{print $2}'`: a worktree path containing a space would be
  # cut at the space, and the guard below would then answer for another path.
  git -C "$r" worktree list --porcelain | sed -n 's/^worktree //p' | while read -r w; do
    # `worktree list` names the bare repository too, and asking IT is the very
    # mistake this loop exists to avoid. Do not try to spot it in the porcelain:
    # a `.bare` created by `git clone --bare` can print a HEAD and a branch and
    # no `bare` marker at all. Ask git whether the path has a work tree.
    [ "$(git -C "$w" rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null)" = "true" ] || continue
    git -C "$w" stash list
    git -C "$w" status --porcelain
  done
done

ls -d /tmp/phpstan /tmp/cache/PHPStan /tmp/rector_cached_files 2>/dev/null
```

**Two process shapes, not one.** The first `pgrep` finds dev servers — the
classic subagent leftover. The second finds what a verification-heavy session
leaves: a backgrounded `make gate`, a `runTests.sh`, a `--watch` on a pull
request, an `until gh run …` loop. Neither pattern catches the other's shape.

**Containers are reported, never stopped.** `docker ps -a` lists every session's
containers, and a machine running several agents shows mostly foreign ones.
Under a heading called *Cleanup* that reads as an instruction; stopping another
session's e2e stack is worse than the mess this gate exists to prevent. Compare
against what was running when the session started, name only the difference as
yours, and list the rest as *foreign — untouched*.

Plus: subagents stopped (`TaskStop`), background watchers ended, no `/loop`
armed. **Before removing a worktree or branch:** `git status --porcelain`,
`git stash list`, `git cherry -v origin/main <branch>` — anything unpushed
stays, and the report says so.

**Stashes are their own row, not a footnote to worktree removal.** They live in
the repository, not in a worktree, so a repo can report a clean tree, no
worktrees and no stray branches while still holding them — and a stash whose
branch is gone is invisible from every other check. Read each one before
dropping it: `git stash show --stat`, then look for its content in the target
(`git stash show -p | grep '^+'` and search a distinctive line on `main`).
Three stashes from March, April and June were each already merged by another
route; the SHA goes in the report so the drop stays reversible.

**A skills grep needs `-R`, not `-r`.** `~/.claude/skills/<name>` can be a
symlink into `~/.agents/skills/<name>` (on installs that link skills from
there), and `grep -r` does not follow a symlinked
directory given as a path argument. A coverage check run with `-r` therefore
reports "not covered" for every term — a clean, confident, wholly wrong
negative that sends the retro on to propose what the skills already say.
Measured 2026-09-21: eight terms, eight NONE with `-r`; with `-R`, five were
already documented.

**Three more rows the obvious list misses.** Each one produced a false "all
done" in the session this mode came out of:

| Check | Why it is not covered above |
|---|---|
| Memory-store consistency: no orphaned notes, no dead index links | A note deleted this session can leave `[[wikilinks]]` in surviving notes; an unindexed note is invisible at session start although the file exists |
| **Author** of every open PR before classifying it | "Renovate handles those" was wrong for one of five — it was an own PR with 14 red checks, waved through by the label rather than read |
| Consumer cache after a release (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<skill>/`) | A published release is not an installed one; "consumers have the fix" is false until the cache shows the version |

## Booking (gate 7)

Determine whether time recording is required, which service owns the record,
and what identifiers and units it requires from the active project or
organization policy. Delegate service-specific operations to its integration.
Do not infer these rules from an installed skill, a ticket prefix, or the fact
that the repository contains skills or infrastructure.

Prepare entries for the applicable days with their evidence and estimation
method. Distinguish human effort, agent elapsed time and billable time; do not
silently equate them or apply a universal gap threshold. Project/activity,
required ticket linkage and field constraints come from the owning policy.
When policy permits ticketless work, do not invent a ticket requirement.

Read existing entries immediately before each approved write to prevent
duplicates, including entries from parallel sessions or synchronized systems.
Read back the result. Never write independently to both sides of a synchronized
service. Missing access, policy or a required identifier remains a visible
blocker with a named next action; it is not permission to guess or mark N/A.

## Integration boundary

Use the responsible forge/tracker/time integration for native reads and
approved writes. Retro owns the evidence gate, not credentials, tool paths,
provider response formats or organization workflow rules. Built-in GitHub and
GitLab feedback readers keep their existing access restrictions. Other tracker
feedback enters through [the local feedback contract](feedback-contract.md).

A bare key or branch name is a hint. Resolve it with its source context before
any external lookup. An unavailable integration, read failure or incomplete
page is unknown evidence, not an empty result. A user may explicitly reject an
irrelevant candidate with a reason: record it as a *rejected* row in gate 2. The
collector does not remember the rejection, so the candidate reappears on the
next run; do not silently discard it.

## Pipeline mapping

- Phases 1–3 (detection) are skipped — announce it in one line — unless gate 3
  triggers the Sweep, which then runs in full.
- Phase 8 (approval) applies to every write Done mode proposes: each booking,
  each ticket comment, each worktree removal with anything unpushed.
- Phase 10 report is the scope line plus the gate table; the word **done**
  appears only when every row is ✅ or N/A.

## Report format

The scope line comes first — without it the table says only "the checks I chose
to run passed", and a reader cannot tell whether gate 4 swept three repositories
or one.

```

A ⏸ or ❌ row ends the report with what is needed to close it — not with
"erledigt". An N/A row needs no follow-up: it carries its reason and is settled.
The word **done** may be said when every row is ✅ or N/A.

## Boundaries

**Never:** stop or remove a container, process or worktree belonging to another
session; mark a structurally impossible row ⏸ instead of N/A; merge, tag or
deploy from Done mode (those are the task's own,
explicitly authorized steps); book time without approval or required policy context; dismiss a scanner
alert to turn a gate green; delete a worktree or branch holding unpushed
commits; declare done with a ⏸ or ❌ in the table.

**Ask first:** missing required tracker identity or policy after checking the owning context; removal of anything
with unpushed work; any ticket transition that closes a ticket someone else
owns.

## Evals

`../evals/done-gate-holds-on-unbooked-time.md` — the gate must refuse "done"
when the retro or the booking is missing, even though the code task is
complete.
