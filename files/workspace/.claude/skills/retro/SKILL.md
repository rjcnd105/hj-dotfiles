# Retro — LLM-driven Session Retrospection

One efficient LLM pass over a session (or the stored memory backlog) detects
**friction and reusable learnings**, classifies each into one of seven
destinations, and materializes approved ones.

**Core principle:** No silent writes — every materialization needs
per-proposal approval.

## Modes

Modes and shared pipeline: `references/workflow.md`.

- **`/retro`** — Sweep: the whole current session.
- **`/retro "<problem>"`** — Spotlight: one described issue.
- **`/retro outcome [session-id|--since N]`** — replay a past session by what
  happened to its output afterward.
- **`/retro audit [--scope project|repo|skill]`** — cross-session architectural
  drift.
- **`/retro promote`** — inventory already-written local memory and re-home each
  note upward (never project-local memory); drain the source only after the
  upward write is verified. See `references/promote-mode.md`.
- **Auto** — optional SessionEnd hook (`hooks/session-end.json`), off by default.

## Pipeline (all modes)

1. Mechanical pre-pass — `scripts/detect-mechanical.py` (Promote substitutes
   `scripts/scan-memory-inventory.py`).
2. LLM enrichment — inferential signals, both classes (friction + learnings
   B16–B18); filter false positives.
3. Cross-session enrichment (optional) — JSONL scan via `scripts/scan-cross-session.py`.
4. Discover skills — `scripts/find-org-skills.py` — **and** the worked-in repo's harness (`project-harness-inspection.md`). Both, or only skill-shaped answers.
5. Classify (`classification-heuristic.md`) — authority first (who owns this
   truth?), then broadest scope; never project-local memory.
6. Eval consultation — read a matched skill's `evals/`; propose a TDD stub.
7. Proposal generation — prose Why + How-to-apply, grouped, ≤10; learnings
   survive the trim.
8. Approval — approve / edit / reject per proposal.
9. Materialize per destination; for Promote, drain the source last (verified).
10. Report.

## Boundaries

**Scope:** session-end/cross-session analysis + skill-PR routing.

**Always:** LLM is primary classifier. Patches go to source repos, never the
cache. Per-private-repo confirmation. Conventional Commits. DCO sign-off
(`git commit -s`). Preserve commit signing.

**Ask first:** skill-match ambiguity, auto-mode activation, private-repo targets,
dirty-worktree fallback, any promotion making a note team-visible.

**Never:** auto-merge, silent writes, bot attribution, skip hooks (`--no-verify`),
patch the cache, hardcode a static skill list, `rm` a drained memory (tombstone).
