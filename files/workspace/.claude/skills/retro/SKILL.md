# Retro — LLM-driven Session Retrospection

One LLM pass over a session or the memory backlog detects **friction and
reusable learnings**, classifies each into one of seven destinations, and
materializes approved ones.

**Core principle:** No silent writes — every materialization needs
approval.

## Modes

- **`/retro`** — Sweep: the whole current session.
- **`/retro "<problem>"`** — Spotlight: one described issue.
- **`/retro outcome [session-id|--since N]`** — replay a past session by its
  outcomes.
- **`/retro audit [--scope project|repo|skill]`** — cross-session architectural
  drift.
- **`/retro promote`** — re-home already-written local memory upward (never
  project-local memory); drain the source only after the upward write is
  verified. See `references/promote-mode.md`.
- **`/retro done`** — definition-of-done gate: seven evidence-backed checks
  (task, findings, retro, cleanup, questions, tickets, time), each ✅ / ❌ /
  ⏸ / N/A. **⏸ only when a named person can close it with a named action;
  what is structurally absent is N/A with its reason** — a ⏸ nobody can close
  makes the whole table get skipped. Say **done** when every row is ✅ or N/A.
  See `references/done-mode.md`.
- **Auto** — optional SessionEnd hook, off by default. It is plugin-level, not
  part of this skill directory: `hooks/session-end.json` at the repository root
  (see README, "Optional auto-trigger").

## Pipeline (all modes)

1. Mechanical pre-pass — `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/detect-mechanical.py` (Promote:
   `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/scan-memory-inventory.py`). It requires `--transcript-file`, and the
   transcript is located **by content** — a token from this session — never by
   mtime: several sessions share one project slug, so the newest JSONL is
   regularly somebody else's. Invocation in `references/workflow.md`.
   Then `uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/collect-review-findings.py` on the
   same transcript (`uv run`, because its header declares the tree-sitter
   parser; plain `python3` stops with a message): review threads, bot reviews,
   and comments on the session's PRs/MRs, their linked issues, plus normalized tracker feedback supplied via
   `--feedback-file` (input for B18–B20, D4, D6). PRs a script opened (a
   fleet driver's `opened.jsonl`) are not in the transcript: pass that file
   with `--pr-list`. Resolve relevant opaque
   hints through the owning integration, never by key shape. See
   `references/feedback-contract.md`; incomplete coverage is not silence.
2. LLM enrichment — inferential signals, both classes (friction + learnings
   B16–B20); filter false positives.
3. Cross-session enrichment (optional) — JSONL scan via `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/scan-cross-session.py`.
4. Discover skills — `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/find-org-skills.py` — and the repo's harness (`project-harness-inspection.md`).
5. Classify (`classification-heuristic.md`) — authority first, then broadest
   scope; never project-local memory.
6. Evals — read a matched skill's `evals/`; propose a TDD stub.
7. Proposals — prose Why + How-to-apply, grouped, ≤10; learnings survive the
   trim.
8. Approval — approve / edit / reject per proposal.
9. Materialize per destination; for Promote, drain the source last (verified).
10. Report.

## Boundaries

**Scope:** session-end/cross-session analysis, skill-PR routing, done gate.
Tracker identity and access belong to the owning integration; QA and time
policy belong to project/organization rules. No implicit tracker, CLI discovery
or organization-specific billing defaults in the core.

**Always:** LLM is primary classifier. Patches go to source repos, never the
cache. Per-private-repo confirmation. Conventional Commits. DCO sign-off
(`git commit -s`). Preserve commit signing.

**Ask first:** skill-match ambiguity, auto-mode activation, private-repo targets,
dirty-worktree fallback, any promotion making a note team-visible.

**Never:** auto-merge, silent writes, harness-invented attribution (a disclosure
the user's rules prescribe is required), skip hooks (`--no-verify`),
patch the cache, hardcode a static skill list, `rm` a drained memory (tombstone);
from Done mode: merge, tag or deploy, or touch another session's containers,
processes or worktrees.
