detect-mechanical.py — Schicht A mechanical friction detector for retro-skill.

Reads a Claude Code session transcript (JSONL) and emits a structured list of
mechanical friction candidates. Output is JSON, consumed by the LLM in Schicht B.

Usage:
    python3 detect-mechanical.py --transcript-file <path> [--output-format json]
    python3 detect-mechanical.py --transcript-file <path> --signals A1,A6,A17

Signals implemented (Schicht A — full catalog):
    A1  Tool errors
    A2  Tool retry clusters
    A3  Tool output verbosity
    A4  Tool call count vs task (inefficiency ratio)
    A5  Sequential calls that could be parallel
    A6  User correction phrases
    A7  Prompt repetition (exact)
    A8  Prompt sequence repetition
    A9  Tool sequence repetition
    A10 Skill in reminder vs invoke
    A11 Wrong tool choice (grep/sed on structured files)
    A12 Re-read same file
    A13 Skipped verification (claim without prior test/build)
    A14 Worked on main/master
    A15 Bot attribution in commit
    A16 Outdated tool warnings
    A17 Upstream failure (git push / gh pr checks)
    A18 Permission re-approval (same prompt ≥3× spread over session)

    Editing a structured file this way is not the misuse A11 looks for - it is
    what the data-tools rule PRESCRIBES. The rule forbids reading values with
    grep and forbids writing a file back through a serializer, because
    `json.dumps` and `jq .` re-emit the whole document in their own formatting
    and turn a three-line change into a full-file diff. What it names as the
    correct form is the Edit tool or a targeted sed on one anchored line, which
    is exactly this shape.

    So the flag fired on the prescribed technique, and because C6 counts A11
    findings it argued for a gate against following the rule. Measured on the
    session that produced this: three of the nine remaining A11 hits were a
    `sed -i` version bump - `ext_emconf.php`, `plugin.json`, `composer.json` -
    each replacing one anchored version string, and one of them was followed by
    a `json.load` check in the same call.

    Narrow on purpose, and the `g` flag is where the line runs. Without it a
    substitution replaces at most once per line, which together with a pattern
    naming the thing being changed is the targeted edit the rule asks for. With
    it the command sweeps every occurrence anywhere in the document, including
    inside keys, comments and substrings - `sed -i 's|foo|bar|g' config.yaml`
    is the sledgehammer A11 exists to catch, and it keeps firing. `g` is a
    proxy rather than a proof of intent, but it is the one signal in the
    command text that separates the two.

    Also only `-i`, so a substitution over a pipe is untouched, and only
    substitutions: `sed -i '5d'` and `sed -i -f edit.sed` still fire because
    neither shows what it does to the document.
