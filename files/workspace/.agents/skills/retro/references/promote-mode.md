# Promote Mode — `/retro promote`

Every other retro mode reads the session **flow** (a transcript) and detects
friction as it happens. Promote reads the accumulated **stock**: the
cwd-scoped memory files Claude Code's default memory behaviour writes to
`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/`. It re-homes each note upward to its correct
destination and drains the source — turning the "never project-local memory"
rule from a *going-forward* policy into an action you can run on the backlog.

It is a new **front-end** for the existing pipeline, not a new pipeline: it
replaces Phases 1–3 (transcript detection) with a filesystem inventory and
reuses Phases 4–10 (classify → approve → materialize → report) unchanged.

## Why this mode exists

Project-local memory (`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/`, a project
`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/feedback/`) is a **knowledge silo**: cwd-scoped, shared with
no one, and invisible from any other slug. A note written while `cwd` resolved
to `-home-sme` is never recalled while working in `-home-sme-p-retro-skill`.
Promote drains that silo into the shareable destinations the taxonomy already
defines, in priority order: **canonical-source › skill-update › project-rule
(`AGENTS.md`) › personal-rule (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)** — see the authority axis
and the scope-escalation rule in `classification-heuristic.md`. A note whose
substance is a fact owned outside the agent system (upstream docs, code, a
schema) promotes to that owner; the skill keeps at most a reference plus the
agent-specific delta.

## What the scanner reads (and excludes)

`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/scan-memory-inventory.py` is read-only by construction. It emits the
same envelope shape as `detect-mechanical.py`, so Phases 4–10 consume it as-is.

| Scanned | Signal | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `<slug>/memory/*.md` (feedback notes) | `C3` memory_drift | The canonical promotable stock |
| `<slug>/memory/MEMORY.md` | — | Read as the index; pruned on drain, never itself a finding |
| `<slug>/memory/.promoted/*.md` | — | Tombstones (already drained) — skipped, never re-emitted |
| `<project>/CLAUDE.md`, `docs/feedback/*.md` | `B8` wrong_destination | **Opt-in** via `--include-flagged-locations` |
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, one finding per `##` section | `C2` cross_project_pattern | **Opt-in** via `--include-global-rules` — see "Draining the global rules file" |

**Excluded by construction** (never part of the scan surface — the scanner only
globs `<slug>/memory/*.md`, so these are never enumerated in the first place):
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` unless `--include-global-rules` is passed and
`<project>/AGENTS.md` always (they are correct *destinations* — re-promoting
them by default loops), and `.serena/memories/*.md` (project-overview
context, not behaviour rules — would pollute global memory).

### Draining the global rules file (`--include-global-rules`)

The global rules file is where personal preferences *land*, so it is not a
default source. It still accumulates a second kind of content: learned rules
whose substance is team-usable procedure or domain fact (a CLI gotcha, a
release recipe, an API trap). Those reach more people as a `skill-update` than
as private prose, and this opt-in surfaces each `##` section so the classifier
can judge it. Three binding rules:

1. **Always-on behavior never leaves the file.** A skill loads only when
   triggered. Rules that must hold in every turn — bans, tone rules,
   assumption-marking, verification discipline — are not promotable to a
   skill; at most they *pair* with an enforcement gate (hook/checkpoint) while
   the prose stays. When in doubt, the section stays.
2. **Two-direction test.** Promote a section only when BOTH hold: the content
   generalizes beyond this user, AND losing it from always-loaded context is
   safe because the owning skill reliably triggers when the content matters.
3. **Drain is an agent edit, not the `drain` subcommand.** The subcommand
   refuses paths outside `<slug>/memory/` by design. After the skill PR is
   verified to exist, remove the section from the rules file with an ordinary
   approval-gated edit, re-checking the scan's `content_sha256` against the
   section text first (same race-check semantics). One section per edit.
   Section-removal is markdown surgery and boundary regexes are FENCE-BLIND: a
   `#`-anchored section-heading boundary also matches `#` comment lines inside code
   fences, leaving orphaned section tails (observed live). Remove sections
   fence-aware (track ``` state, or operate on a parsed structure), and verify
   afterwards that fences are balanced and the section count dropped by exactly
   the number removed.

Each finding carries the source note's verbatim `**Why:**` / `**How to apply:**`
prose, its `origin_session_id`, a `current_location` tag (the load-bearing
evidence the LLM reads at Phase 5), and a `content_sha256` used as both an
idempotency key and a drain race-check.

### Scope

`--project` with a leading-dash slug needs the equals form (`--project=-home-user-projects`) — argparse consumes the bare form as an option and errors "expected one argument".

By default the scanner enumerates **every** slug that has a `memory/` dir;
`--project=<slug>` narrows it to one. There is no `--scope` flag and there never
was — earlier versions of this page and of the command documented `--scope
cwd|all`, which the script rejects with exit 2, so every documented promote run
died at argument parsing. The scanner **always** reports `slugs_scanned`, so an
empty result reads as "scanned X, found nothing" rather than a silent skip; that
guards the worktree-vs-parent slug split, since the real stock often lives
under a sibling slug. Narrow with `--project=` only when you know which slug
holds it.

## Batch semantics — a proposal absorbs notes, the cap counts proposals

A backlog drain meets hundreds of notes; per-note proposals under the ≤10 cap
would spread one drain across dozens of sessions. In promote mode a **proposal
is destination-shaped, not note-shaped**: one proposal = one materialization
target (one skill PR, one AGENTS.md append), absorbing every scanned note that
classifies to it. Rules:

- The proposal lists every absorbed note by path, with its `content_sha256`.
  Approval of the proposal approves the set; the user can strike individual
  notes from the list.
- One proposal counts once against the ≤10 cap regardless of how many notes it
  absorbs.
- The mechanical halves of a materialization repeat identically per proposal —
  use `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/materialize-pr.sh` (`start` = fetch + fresh worktree off the
  default branch; `finish` = stage ONLY named files, signed commit, push, PR
  via `--body-file`) instead of hand-typing the sequence dozens of times.
- Drain stays per-note: each absorbed note is drained individually (verified
  materialization first), so a partially-landed proposal leaves the
  unmaterialized notes in place.

### Classifying a large backlog

Past roughly fifty notes, reading every note and every candidate target in the
main context does not fit. What worked on a 190-note store:

1. Split the inventory into topic buckets of 20–60 notes (one forge, one
   tracker, the skill fleet, one product family, general behaviour rules), so
   each bucket has two to five candidate target skills.
2. Give each bucket to a read-only classifier agent with the bucket's file list
   and `content_sha256` values. It fetches each candidate skill repo and greps
   its `origin/main` (never the installed copy), checks the global rules file,
   and returns one verdict per note — covered, partial, new, stale, historical
   — with a `file:line` it actually saw. Run at most three at a time.
3. Build the destination-shaped proposals from the merged verdict tables, and
   keep the tables in a durable file next to the proposals.
4. Materialize one agent per target repository, again read-only except for its
   own worktree, and drain each note only after its PR or MR URL is read back.

The classifier verdicts are claims. Before a correction ("the skill says X,
which is false") reaches the user, re-check its `file:line` yourself.

## Verify before promoting — stale facts and paraphrase duplicates

Two checks run at Phase 7, before a note enters a proposal:

- **Stale-check.** Every note records what was true when written — not only
  `reference` notes. Verify its load-bearing claim against reality before it
  enters a proposal, and know which of two kinds of claim it makes:
  - **Existence** — a path, flag, endpoint or version. Check that it still
    exists.
  - **State** — something is still open, not yet done, unreleased, waiting on
    someone. This kind turns false the moment the thing happens, without a
    word of the note changing, and an existence check passes it. The scanner
    marks these in English and German (`noch nicht`, `steht aus`, `noch
    offen`, …): `pending_state` lists the phrases, and
    `pending_state_in_index` is true when one sits in the description.

    The flag is a reason to look, not a verdict. It skips `feedback` notes,
    because a rule speaks in conditionals and "still open" inside a rule is
    not a claim that something is open now. And it deliberately does not
    match `blocked`: on a real store that word never once marked a pending
    claim — it named merge states, status enums and resolver behaviour.

  Check the **description first**. It is the line `MEMORY.md` carries, loaded
  into every session, while the body is read only on demand — so a stale state
  in the description misleads each session and a stale state in the body only
  whoever opens it. The note that prompted this was accurate on the day it was
  written, resolved the next day, and stood in the index for a week reading
  "all wait on one unreleased repo"; its body stayed historically correct
  throughout. A stale note is proposed for **tombstone-only drain** (no upward
  write), clearly labeled — or, where part of it is still true, for a rewrite
  that keeps only that part.
- **Paraphrase dedup.** `content_sha256` catches identical text, not the same
  rule reworded — and stock notes are often already duplicated into
  `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or the target skill. Read the *target* location and
  compare mechanisms (not titles): if the target already covers the same
  mechanism, the note is proposed for tombstone-only drain with the covering
  location cited; if the target covers an adjacent mechanism only, promote and
  say what is genuinely new. This is the same read-the-target rule as
  "Instruction pruning" in `classification-heuristic.md`.

## Materialize-then-drain (Phase 9)

Source deletion is **last** and **gated on confirmed materialization**, per item:

1. **Write/PR first** — append the titled rule to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or
   `<project>/AGENTS.md`, or open the `feat/retro-<slug>` PR with a signed
   (`git commit -s`) commit.
2. **Verify** — for file appends, re-read the target and confirm the rule text
   is present; for PRs, confirm `gh`/`glab` returned a URL (PR *exists* =
   materialized; merge is not required).
3. **Drain only now** — `scan-memory-inventory.py drain <path> --expect-sha256 <sha>`
   tombstone-**moves** the source into `<slug>/memory/.promoted/` (never `rm`)
   and prunes its `MEMORY.md` entry: only the link to the note goes, with its
   own hook text and one ` · ` separator. The bullet marker, a leading label,
   sibling links and rule text outside the link stay; the line goes only when
   nothing but the marker and a label remains. The `--expect-sha256`
   race-check aborts the drain if the file changed since the scan.

On any verification failure, **keep the source** and report it. Rejected
proposals are never drained.

**A memory store that is itself versioned needs a sync after the drain.** When
the store is backed up in a dotfiles repository, the drained notes still sit in
that repository. An installer that copies the repository back onto the machine
then restores every drained note, and a capture that copies only tracked files
from the machine neither removes them nor picks up the new tombstones. After
the drain, mirror the store's directory into the repository — note removals
and new `.promoted/` files included — and commit it before anyone runs the
installer. Git records each drained note as a rename into `.promoted/`.

## Risk controls

1. **Naming.** `promote` names exactly what Phases 7–9 do (re-home upward by
   reach) and fits the `/retro <verb>` convention. (`dream` / `upsert` rejected.)
2. **Team-visibility of personal notes.** Two layers: (a) at Phase 5, personal
   content (a `$HOME` path, an "I prefer…" style note) is **not** auto-escalated
   past personal-rule; (b) at Phase 8, every `project-rule` / `skill-update`
   proposal triggers a mandatory, default-**N** warning stating exactly where it
   becomes team-visible and that the source is currently private. The promotion
   and its paired drain are one approval unit.
3. **Deletion timing / data loss.** Strict write → verify → drain ordering;
   drain is a reversible tombstone move, never `rm`; no verified success → no
   drain, ever; sha256 race-check guards concurrent edits.
4. **Not everything should escalate.** Store-class discrimination keeps the
   scanner to genuine silos; correct destinations and Serena context are never
   emitted; the `drain` subcommand refuses any path not under a `<slug>/memory/`
   store, so a drained note can't be re-filed downward.
5. **Separation from `audit`.** Clean seam by input and output: `audit` reads
   cross-session transcripts/git history over weeks and skews to ADR/harness
   destinations; `promote` reads the filesystem stock of memory files (no
   transcript, no time window) and skews to user/project/skill destinations.
