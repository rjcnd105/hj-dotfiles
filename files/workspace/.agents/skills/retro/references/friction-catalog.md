# Friction Catalog

All signals retro-skill detects, organized in four layers (Schichten) by
detection mechanism and a fifth (constitutional) for cross-session architectural
analysis.

Despite the name, this catalog covers **two classes**: *friction* (things that
went wrong) and *reusable learnings* (knowledge that went right but is not
captured anywhere — Schicht B, signals B16–B18). Both are first-class retro
findings; a signal-free stretch of a session can still carry a learning worth
propagating.

## Scope and honest limitations

This catalog covers what retro-skill **can** detect from session transcripts, post-session git/PR history, and cross-session JSONL data.

**It does NOT detect:**
- Architectural choices that are wrong but "work" (no friction signal)
- External feedback the agent never saw (production alerts, customer complaints, Slack/Jira mentions)
- Slow constitutional drift unless `/retro audit` mode is run with sufficient history

External-feedback ingestion (Sentry, Jira, monitoring) is out of v0.1 scope — see "Future directions" at the bottom.

## Implementation status (v0.1.1)

| Schicht | Catalog signals | Implemented in code |
|---|---|---|
| A — Mechanical | 18 | 18 (all of A1–A18) |
| B — LLM inference | 18 | LLM-driven (no separate code); B16–B18 are reusable-learning signals |
| C — Cross-session | 5 | Partial (script `scan-cross-session.py`) |
| D — Outcome | 12 | Planned for v0.1.x; D11 (codify-success) and D12 (prune-superseded-copy) are the positive signals |
| E — Constitutional (audit) | 6 | Planned for v0.1.x |

Schicht A is feature-complete. See `references/destination-taxonomy.md` for what each signal class routes to.

## Schicht A — Mechanical (Python pre-pass)

Fast, deterministic, regex/count-based. Runs before LLM pass to reduce token cost. See `scripts/detect-mechanical.py`.

| # | Signal | Detection | Hint at |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Tool error rate | `exit_code != 0` or `is_error: true` in tool_use_result | Wrong tool, wrong args, missing tool |
| A2 | Tool retry cluster | Same tool + similar args ≥3× within N turns | Tool misunderstanding, missing docs |
| A3 | Tool output verbosity | `len(tool_result) > X` without subsequent filter | Token waste, wrong tool (cat vs head, full Read vs Range) |
| A4 | Tool call count vs task | Total tool calls / user messages ratio above threshold | Inefficiency for simple task |
| A5 | Sequential vs parallel | Multiple independent calls serial in separate blocks | Performance waste |
| A6 | User correction phrases | Line-start openers (EN + DE: `no\|nope\|stop\|don't\|wrong\|nein\|nicht\|falsch\|quatsch\|warum\|wieso\|manno` …) **plus** curated mid-line DE phrases (`raus damit`, `endlich mal`, `so nicht`, `mach … selber`, `sei genau` …), ALL CAPS, `!!!` | Classic friction — DE speakers correct mid-sentence, which line-anchored EN openers miss |
| A7 | Prompt repetition | Semantic similarity of user messages within N turns | Assistant didn't understand |
| A8 | Prompt sequence repetition | n-gram match (n=2..5) over user message sequence | Workflow ripe for snippet/command |
| A9 | Tool sequence repetition | n-gram match over tool_use names + arg templates | Composition opportunity, skill instruction gap |
| A10 | Skill in reminder vs invoke | `<command-name>` in system reminder, no matching Skill call | Skill not triggered |
| A11 | Wrong tool choice | `grep` on JSON, `sed` on YAML, `cat` for huge file (not: `tail` on a task output or log, which Read cannot do) | Tool-not-used / wrong tool |
| A12 | Re-read same file | Read tool same path ≥2× without intervening Edit | Caching opportunity |
| A13 | Skipped verification | Claim "tests pass" / "fixed" without prior test/build run | Verification skip |
| A14 | Worked on main/master | Git commands without prior `checkout -b` | Workflow violation |
| A15 | Bot attribution in commit | Commit message contains "Generated with Claude" / "Co-Authored-By: Claude" | Known user rule violated |
| A16 | Outdated tool warning | "deprecated", "is now", "use X instead" patterns in stderr | Out-of-date knowledge |
| A17 | Upstream failure | `git push` fails on pre-receive, `gh pr checks` fails post-push, post-commit lint fail | Pre-push verification gap (shift-left) |
| A18 | Permission re-approval | Same permission prompt approved ≥3× in session | Allowlist needed |
| A19 | Repeated command shape | One program+subcommand shape invoked >=8x (plumbing excluded, remote calls flagged) | The same derived answer recomputed by hand — script candidate |
| A20 | Wait-loop inefficiency | `until`/`while` + `sleep` polling, flagged when it exits only on a backlog counter reaching zero | Learns nothing until the slowest job ends; the first failure was workable much earlier |

## Schicht B — LLM Inference

Requires conversational context understanding. The LLM reads pre-pass output + relevant transcript excerpts.

| # | Signal | Hint at |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | Output quality mismatch | Assistant's verbosity / style differed from user's implicit expectation |
| B2 | Wrong skill choice | Skill X was triggered, Skill Y would have fit better |
| B3 | Skill capability gap | Skill triggered, lacked guidance for sub-task |
| B4 | Skill description mismatch | User question should have triggered Skill X, but its `description` doesn't match |
| B5 | Hallucination / fact check | Assistant claimed X, later refuted by verification or user |
| B6 | Convention violation | Code doesn't match project style — no lint fail, but off |
| B7 | Missing skill | Recurring task with no installed skill matching |
| B8 | Wrong-destination materialization | Assistant wrote learning to wrong file (e.g. AGENTS.md instead of feedback memory) |
| B9 | Repeated mistake in session | Same error N× in same session — lesson not learned |
| B10 | Approval bypassed | Assistant performed irreversible action without user confirmation |
| B11 | Plan / spec skipped | Non-trivial task started without TodoWrite/plan/spec |
| B12 | Assumption without asking | Assistant made an assumption later refuted; should have used spec-driven-development |
| B13 | Context re-discovery | Assistant re-explored repo structure already documented in AGENTS.md |
| B14 | Doc drift | Assistant used outdated API/library version when context7 would have helped |
| B15 | Skill trigger-coverage gap | A **systematic** pass (not opportunistic): load *every* installed skill's `description` via `scripts/find-installed-skills.sh`, then judge — given what this session actually did — which skills *should* have triggered but were never invoked. Each miss whose root cause is weak/missing trigger words → `skill-update` to that skill's `description`. (B2/B4 are the opportunistic, single-skill version; B15 is the exhaustive sweep across the whole inventory. See the trigger-coverage step in `SKILL.md`.) |

### Reusable-learning signals (B16–B18) — scan even when nothing went wrong

These are **positive** signals: the session produced knowledge worth propagating,
with **no** friction to trigger it. The mechanical pre-pass cannot see them (there
is no error, retry, or correction to count), so they exist only as LLM-inference
signals and must be looked for deliberately. The discriminator is *"would a future
agent re-derive this, and is it already in the owning skill?"* — not *"did
something go wrong?"* Grade them **at least `important`** (see
`classification-heuristic.md` → Severity) so they are not crowded out under the
≤10-proposal cap. The `skill-update` arrows below assume the authority check
(Axis 0 in `classification-heuristic.md`) has already run: a learning whose
substance is a fact about the world — tool behaviour, an API, a standard —
routes to `canonical-source` (the owning docs/code), with the skill keeping
only a reference plus the agent-specific delta.

| # | Signal | Hint at |
|---|---|---|
| B16 | Hard-won technique | A non-obvious command / flag / endpoint / API / workflow the session figured out — even cleanly and first-try — that is NOT in the owning skill. Root cause: real digging was needed. → `skill-update` |
| B17 | Proactive improvement | A better approach identified *during* the work (not prompted by a correction) — a cleaner pattern, a faster tool, a simpler structure worth codifying. → `skill-update` |
| B18 | Review-issue learning | A generalizable lesson from a code-review comment (given OR received) — a reviewer taught a rule that applies beyond the current diff. → `skill-update` (or `project-rule` if genuinely repo-specific) |

## Schicht C — Cross-Session

Not detectable from a single session. Session-file scan across projects.

| # | Signal | Hint at | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Same friction again | Same correction across multiple sessions — memory didn't stick | Multi-session JSONL scan |
| C2 | Cross-project pattern | Same friction class in N≥2 projects | Multi-session JSONL grouped by project |
| C3 | Memory drift | `feedback_*.md` exists but assistant violated it anyway → skill needs it more prominently | JSONL diff against memory files |
| C4 | Skill update ineffective | Previous PR to skill X, same bug returned afterward | Git log of skill repo + JSONL |
| C6 | Written rule violated repeatedly | A signal fired >=3x while a matching rule already exists in the always-loaded instructions | Prose has demonstrably failed — needs a mechanical gate |
| C5 | Follow-up-fix session | A later session exists primarily to fix what an earlier session broke (mentions earlier commits, works on same files within 7 days with reverting edits, or `git revert` of earlier commits) | Cross-session JSONL + git log |

## Schicht D — Outcome (Post-Session, requires latency)

What happened to the session's output **after** it left the session — good OR
bad? These signals require waiting (days to weeks) before they become reliable.
Best run periodically via `/retro outcome --since 30d`, not at session end.

D1–D10 are **failure** signals (output that didn't survive). **D11 is the
positive mirror:** output that *did* survive is a validated statement of "this is
the way," and its generalizable approach should be codified so future generated
code follows it. A commit is a hypothesis at commit time; it becomes a reliable
"new way" only once it is merged, unreverted, and CI-green — which is exactly what
latency-gated outcome mode confirms. (This mirrors the Schicht B fix: just as the
sweep was friction-only, outcome was failure-only.)

| # | Signal | Detection | Hint at |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Session commit reverted | `git log --grep="revert" + ($commit_sha within revert body)` | Output was wrong |
| D2 | Session commit superseded | Same file touched again within 7 days, diff shows substantial revert of session's changes | Output unfinished or wrong direction |
| D3 | Session PR closed without merge | `gh pr view --json closedAt,merged,state` shows closed, not merged | Output rejected |
| D4 | Session PR required major changes | `gh pr view --json reviews` has CHANGES_REQUESTED with substantive review body | Output below standard |
| D5 | CI failed on session commit | `gh run list --commit $sha --json conclusion` | Output was broken |
| D6 | Issue filed referencing session files | `gh issue list --search "filename after:$session_date"` | Output caused a bug |
| D7 | Follow-up session detected | Schicht C5 cross-referenced from outcome perspective | Session output didn't last |
| D8 | Regression in test suite | Test that passed at session end now fails on a later commit | Output regressed |
| D9 | Code reverted in same file within 30 days | Diff-based: session's net contribution to file is largely undone | Output not durable |
| D10 | External tracker mention (out-of-scope marker) | Issue/PR/Slack reference using session commit/PR ID (requires external integration; v0.2+) | Output had external impact |
| **D11** | **Durable improvement (positive)** | Session's change **survived** the window: merged (`gh pr view --json mergedAt,reviewDecision`), **not** reverted or superseded (inverse of D1/D2/D9), CI green (`gh run list --commit $sha --json conclusion`) — AND its approach generalizes but is not yet in any skill | Output is validated by surviving contact with reality → **codify the approach** so future generated code follows it → `skill-update` |
| **D12** | **Superseded temporary copy (positive/cleanup)** | A `canonical-source` upstream PR tracked by a labelled temporary copy (authority label + upstream PR/issue link + `Learning-Id`, per `destination-taxonomy.md` §7) **merged** during the window (`gh pr view <url> --json state,mergedAt`), while the skill still carries the copy | The fact now lives with its canonical owner → **prune the copy to a reference** (+ agent-specific delta) → `skill-update` (prune); find the copy via its `Learning-Id` |

### Stale-open is not an outcome

Read the diff, not the metadata. A PR/MR that is **still open and old** is
*undecided*, not rejected. It is
neither D3 (closed without merge) nor a failure signal — and it must never be
classified "obsolete" from metadata alone. Age, a `has_conflicts` flag, and a
title keyword ("migration", "drop X") are **identical** for a dead change and
for a *blocked cleanup change* that is exactly what should land once its
precondition is met. The difference lives only in the diff and in the current
state of the target branch.

Before calling any stale-open artefact obsolete:

1. **Read its diff.** What would merging it actually do?
2. **Read the target branch now.** Does `main` already contain what the diff
   would do? Only then is it genuinely obsolete → propose closing it.
3. **Otherwise it is blocked, not dead.** The classification is "blocked", and
   the useful question is *by what* — surface the precondition, do not propose a
   close.

A migration-completion or cleanup PR is the textbook trap: it looks abandoned
and is in fact the finish line waiting on a cutover.

### When NOT to use Schicht D

- Session is too recent (< 24h) — most D signals haven't had time to manifest
- Session was a refactor or doc-only change — D2/D9 fire spuriously
- Working on a long-lived feature branch — `git log --grep="revert"` is noisy
- Change is **local / specific with no transferable approach** — D11 must NOT fire; codifying a one-off is exactly the noise the generalizability filter exists to stop (see B16–B18: "would a future agent re-derive this?")
- A PR/MR is **open and stale** — that is not a D-signal at all; see [Stale-open is not an outcome](#stale-open-is-not-an-outcome) above before proposing to close it

D mode is best for **monthly retros over a 30-day window**, not real-time.

## Schicht E — Constitutional (Audit mode only)

Cross-session architectural patterns. Detectable only with longer horizon (weeks/months). Output class is "architectural finding", not "friction finding" — different severity logic, different destinations (often `project-rule` + ADR update, not `skill-update`).

| # | Signal | Detection | Hint at |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | ADR violation pattern | Active ADRs declare X; recent N sessions violated X | Design erosion |
| E2 | AGENTS.md rule compliance trend | `feedback_*.md` files exist but sessions repeatedly violate them | Rules aren't reaching the agent |
| E3 | Test coverage trend | Coverage over recent commits trending down | Regression in quality discipline |
| E4 | Skill-inventory drift | Skill count growing without corresponding scope; redundant skills present | Bloat / fragmentation |
| E5 | Dependency staleness trend | Outdated-tool warnings (A16) recurring across sessions | Library maintenance gap |
| E6 | Convention divergence | Style/naming patterns diverging across recent commits | Onboarding or review gap |

E mode is best for **monthly or quarterly reviews**, with tech-lead-level actor and ADR-style output (not per-developer per-session).

## Future directions (out of v0.1.x scope)

External-feedback ingestion would extend the catalog significantly:

- **Sentry / error tracker integration** — production crashes correlated to session-touched files
- **Jira / Linear bug filings** — tickets mentioning session output
- **Slack / Matrix mentions** — customer/team feedback referencing session commits
- **PagerDuty / OnCall** — production incidents correlated to session output
- **Documentation drift detection** — docs changed but corresponding code didn't (or vice versa)

Each source needs an integration. Track interest before implementing.

## Notes

- **Pre-pass output is structured JSON** consumed by the LLM in Schicht B. The LLM doesn't re-scan the transcript for A-signals.
- **False positives are expected** in Schicht A; B filters them.
- **Schicht C is optional**. It scans session JSONL across projects; absence of multi-session history just means C-signals stay empty.
- **Schicht D requires latency.** Don't run at session end; run monthly with `--since 30d`.
- **Schicht E (audit mode) requires longer horizon.** Quarterly cadence; tech-lead actor.
- **Severity grading happens during classification**, not detection. A single A1 (tool error) might be trivial or critical depending on context — the LLM decides during enrichment.
