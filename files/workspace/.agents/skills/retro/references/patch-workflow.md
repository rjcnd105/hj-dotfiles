# Patch Workflow

How `/retro` materializes the repo-patching destinations: `skill-update`,
`new-skill` (both against a *skill source repo*), and `harness-artefact`
(against the *target repo where the friction happened*). See
"Harness artefacts" below for what differs in the third case.

## Core rule

**Patches always target the source repo. Never the local plugin cache.**

Cache (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/`) is overwritten on plugin update. Edits there are lost.

## Workspace selection

For each skill-update target, select a working directory in this order:

1. **Existing worktree:** `~/p/<skill-name>/main/` exists as worktree AND is clean
   → Use it. Enables seamless manual follow-up by user.
2. **Existing flat checkout:** `~/p/<skill-name>/` exists as flat git checkout AND is clean AND on main
   → Use it.
3. **Fresh clone:** Otherwise clone into `/tmp/retro-workspace/<skill-name>/`
   → Tell user where the clone lives in case they want to inspect.

If the existing checkout is **dirty** (uncommitted changes), do NOT use it — fall back to /tmp clone. Tell the user why:

```
~/p/<skill>/main/ has 3 uncommitted changes; using /tmp/retro-workspace/<skill>/ instead.
```

## Dedup check: has the fix already landed?

Before authoring anything, search the target repo for the fix already existing —
the incident that produced this finding was usually also worked by someone else
(a sibling session, a parallel retro, the maintainer). After fetching, on the
current default branch:

```bash
git log --oneline -20 origin/main -- <files the fix would touch>
git log --grep '<incident keyword>' --oneline origin/main
gh pr list --repo <owner/repo> --state all --search '<incident keyword>' --limit 10
```

A duplicate found is a proposal **withdrawn** (or re-scoped to the delta the
landed fix lacks), not a second PR. Skipping this check does not fail fast — it
fails at merge time, days later, as a rebase conflict whose main side already
contains the feature, and the reflexive keep-my-side resolution then *reverts*
whatever the landed version gained since. Observed 2026-08-18:
`netresearch/jira-skill` #194, a retro-authored port that an independently
merged commit (39ed9ce) had superseded with a hardened variant; the PR survived
five days and two review passes before the conflict exposed it, and preferring
the PR side would have silently dropped main's mention gate.

## Branch naming

```
feat/retro-<short-slug>
```

Slug derived from finding title, kebab-case, max 40 chars.

Examples:
- `feat/retro-add-bun-vs-npm-rule`
- `feat/retro-fix-yaml-parse-tool-choice`

## Commit conventions

- **Conventional Commits format:** `<type>(<scope>): <summary>`
- **`Learning-Id:` trailer** in every retro materialization commit: a stable
  id minted at Phase 7 per finding (`retro-YYYYMMDD-<slug>`, e.g.
  `retro-20260814-copilot-quota-monthly`). The same id goes into the PR body,
  a materialized checkpoint's `learning_id:` field, and an eval stub's
  frontmatter. It is the provenance chain: `git log --grep 'Learning-Id:'`
  and a grep over `checkpoints.yaml` recover every artefact a finding
  produced — which is what makes a landed learning traceable, and prunable
  when superseded (D12).
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`
- **DCO sign-off (required).** Commit with `git commit -s` so a `Signed-off-by:`
  trailer matching the commit author is added. Netresearch skill repos enforce
  the DCO check — **without sign-off the PR is BLOCKED even when every other
  check is green** (this is the single most common reason retro-created PRs
  stall). Before pushing, verify:
  ```bash
  git log -1 --format='%(trailers:key=Signed-off-by)'   # must be non-empty
  ```
- **Pass the message via `-F <file>`, not inline `-m`,** whenever it contains
  quotes, backticks, or other shell-special characters — inline `-m` mangles
  them mid-shell and produces a corrupted or partial commit message.
- **No bot attribution.** Never add "Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By: Claude" — see the user's global rules.
- **Preserve signing.** Never pass `--no-gpg-sign` or `-c commit.gpgsign=false` — see the user's global rules (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`). (GPG signing and DCO sign-off are independent — you need *both*.)
- **Preserve hooks.** Never pass `--no-verify`. If a hook fails, investigate.
- **Atomic.** One logical change per commit.

Commit message body should reference the friction:

```
feat(triggers): add bun detection to trigger description

A /retro session on 2026-05-11 found the assistant suggested npm
in 4 turns despite the project using bun. The skill description
didn't include 'bun' as a trigger keyword.
```

## Self-review before push

A `/retro` skill-update **authors content into another skill** — commands,
recipes, code examples. That content can be plausible but wrong, and once
merged it ships as authoritative guidance. Before pushing, re-read your own
diff and check:

- Every command/recipe you wrote **would actually run as written** (flags exist,
  quoting is correct, the example is internally consistent — e.g. don't claim an
  *unescaped* quote closes a string while showing an *escaped* one).
- Any "do X then Y" sequence is coherent (no step that contradicts a prior step).
- The root cause in the commit/PR body is one you **verified**, not inferred — if
  you didn't confirm it, say "suspected" rather than asserting it.
- **Prefer deletion over exception.** If the friction is caused by an obsolete or
  harmful instruction, a `skill-update` may be a pure *removal* diff — don't add a
  new exception alongside the bad rule (see `classification-heuristic.md` →
  "Instruction pruning"). Cite where the behaviour is already covered.
- **Reject wording-only churn.** If an edit only rephrases without changing
  behaviour, drop it — it is noise the next retro will re-flag.
- **Run the target skill's own gates locally — reading the diff is not enough.**
  Before pushing, run the destination repo's validator (`skill-repo`'s
  `validate-skill.sh`: SKILL.md word cap, frontmatter, structure), its linters,
  and any script self-tests. A structural gate like the 500-word SKILL.md limit
  fails in CI, never in a re-read — and note SKILL.md often sits *at* the cap, so
  put new prose in a reference file, not SKILL.md.
- **Change every occurrence of a recurring rule in one pass.** When the fix is a
  policy stated in more than one place (a SKILL.md step, a reference section, a
  script header/output), grep the term and update all of them together, then
  confirm no file still states the old rule. Reactive one-spot edits leave the
  skill contradicting itself.

Observed failures: a retro shipped a self-contradictory `--force-with-lease`
recipe and a contradictory escaping example, both caught only by an external
reviewer, plus a wrong "main lags origin" root cause that only the user caught. A
later retro broke the target's Skill Validation CI (the SKILL.md edit went over
the 500-word cap, invisible to a diff read), and a policy change patched one spot
at a time, leaving a SKILL.md step contradicting its own reference across several
review rounds until the user demanded it be done in one coherent pass. A
30-second self-review plus running the target's validator would have caught all
of these.

## PR creation

GitHub:
```bash
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "<body>"
```

GitLab (Netresearch internal):
```bash
glab mr create --hostname git.netresearch.de --title "<title>" --description "<body>"
```

If `$GITLAB_HOST` is set, omit `--hostname`.

### PR body template

## Change

<what was changed>

## Test plan

- [ ] <verification step>

```

The Symptom/Cause/Required behavior/Verification fields follow the canonical
failure-pattern schema defined in `skill-repo-skill`'s
[skills/skill-repo/references/materialization-contract.md](https://github.com/netresearch/skill-repo-skill/blob/main/skills/skill-repo/references/materialization-contract.md) — do not redefine the schema here.

## Per-private-repo confirmation

Before pushing to a private host, prompt the user:

```
Target: git.netresearch.de/x/y (private)
This will push to a private host. Proceed? [y/N]
```

Decision is remembered for the (session, repo URL) pair.

## Harness artefacts — target repo, not skill repo

`harness-artefact` (destination 6) patches the repo the friction happened in.
Everything above still applies — branch naming, Conventional Commits, DCO
sign-off, signing, no `--no-verify`, self-review, PR body — with five
differences.

### 1. Target selection

The target is the repo the session was working in, not a skill repo. Skill
discovery does not apply; there is nothing to look up. The instrument is chosen
by enforcement strength, not convenience — see
`agent-harness-skill/references/enforcement-mechanisms.md`, which ranks all ten
from server-side to convention-based.

That repo is usually **dirty**, because the session just worked in it. Do not
stash and do not commit unrelated work. Add a worktree off the same repo and
patch there:

```bash
git -C <repo>/.bare worktree add ../feat-retro-<slug> -b feat/retro-<slug> origin/<default-branch>
```

Fall back to the /tmp clone rule above if the repo is not worktree-shaped. Never
patch a repo the user did not work in during the session without asking.

### 2. Verify before bootstrapping

`agent-harness-skill` requires **verify first, bootstrap second**. Before
proposing any artefact, check whether it already exists —
`agent-harness-skill/scripts/verify-harness.sh` reports this, and
`agent-harness-skill/checkpoints.yaml` (`AH-*`) names the exact file globs. A
hook config, a CI workflow, and a PR template are almost never absent outright;
the real finding is usually that the existing one does not cover this check.

Extend the existing artefact. Never overwrite a hook config or a workflow file
with a template — that silently drops whatever the team already enforces.

### 3. CI/hook parity is part of the materialization

If the proposed artefact is a CI check meeting the fast-check definition
(deterministic, under ~5s, no external dependencies — see
`enforcement-mechanisms.md`), the same command must also land in the repo's
pre-commit hook config, in the **same PR**. A CI check without the matching hook
is a half-materialized proposal; say so rather than shipping the half.

The reverse does not hold: a hook may exist without a CI counterpart only when
the check cannot run in CI at all, which is rare.

### 4. Server-side instruments are not a PR

Branch protection and rulesets are the only instruments nobody bypasses, and
they are an API call, not a file. They cannot be materialized as a patch and
must never be applied silently. Emit the command for the user to run and mark
the row `manual` in the Phase-11 report:

```bash
gh api -X PUT repos/<owner>/<repo>/branches/<branch>/protection --input <spec>.json
```

State what the rule would enforce and what it would block. The user runs it.

### 5. Linter and analyzer rules

A new rule in a linter the repo already runs needs no new instrument and no new
file — it is a config edit (`phpstan.neon` level, an ESLint rule entry, a
`.yamllint.yml` rule, `fail_level: error` on a reviewdog action). Prefer it over
a new hook or workflow whenever the analyzer is already wired in.

Verify the rule actually fires on the friction as it occurred before proposing
it. A rule that does not reproduce the failure is not a gate.

## New-skill workflow

For `new-skill` destination:

1. Confirm name with user (kebab-case)
2. Confirm target org (default: same org as similar existing skills)
3. Invoke `skill-repo-skill` scaffolding (see its [skills/skill-repo/references/materialization-contract.md](https://github.com/netresearch/skill-repo-skill/blob/main/skills/skill-repo/references/materialization-contract.md))
4. Initial commit includes:
   - Standard scaffolding (plugin.json, composer.json, licenses, README, AGENTS.md)
   - One reference doc covering the friction pattern
   - One eval covering the friction (TDD)
   - SKILL.md with initial trigger description and workflow

User confirms before push. Marketplace listing is a separate manual step (out of scope).

## Reporting

At end of `/retro`, output a table:

```
| # | Destination | Action | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | personal-rule | wrote | ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md | ✓ |
| 2 | skill-update | opened PR | github.com/.../foo-skill#42 | ✓ |
| 3 | checkpoint | edited | bar-skill/checkpoints.yaml (AH-12) | ✓ pending push |
| 4a | harness-artefact | opened PR | github.com/.../app#77 (lefthook.yml) | ✓ |
| 4b | skill-update | opened PR | github.com/.../baz-skill#12 (install recipe) | ✓ |
| 5 | harness-artefact | manual | branch protection — command emitted, not applied | ⚠ user action |
```

A paired materialization (`destination-taxonomy.md`, "Paired materialization")
occupies two rows sharing one number, as `4a`/`4b` above — one approval, two
artefacts, each with its own status so a half-failed pair stays visible.
Server-side instruments are reported `manual`; they are never applied by retro.

## Bulk / outward materializations: deterministic text, byte verification

When one finding materializes into MANY artefacts (a PR fan-out) or into a
foreign org, do not let each agent re-type the approved text:

1. Encode the exact approved content in a patch script (anchored inserts
   with assertions) — the approval covers bytes, not intent.
2. Agents apply the script mechanically; an assertion failure is returned,
   never repaired creatively.
3. A verifier rebuilds base + patch and compares **byte-identical** (sha256)
   against each pushed head, plus trailers/sign-off — "looks the same" is
   not verification.

Same materialize-then-verify discipline as promote mode, applied to outward
writes; nine upstream PRs shipped drift-free this way (2026-08-14).
